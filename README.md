# Functions-with-Python
Using different functions in Python.
<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of using different functions in Python that will help us to:
<br />
- Importing files
<br />
- Using "with" function
<br />
- Using "open" function
<br />
- Reading files
<br />
- Editing files
<br />
- Using the "print" function to display results
<br />
- Removing lists
<br />
- Using "in" function
<br />
- Using "if" function
<br />
- Using "join"
<br />
- Using ".split" 


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>

To import a file into Python, you must use "import_file" followed by the file you are importing. "with open(import_file, "r") we are only reading as a file. The allow list is a list of allowed IP addresses in this specific network.

<br />
Using "print(ip_addresses.split())", the ip addresses stores in the index "ip_addresses" will be displayed. The split method splits the string into a list.

<br />
Adding a "remove_list" gives us the list we want omitted from the "allow_list". Using the "for" method, we can remove the IP addresses that we want removed.

<br />
Using the "if" function along with "in" removes "elements" in remove_list from the IP addresses.

<br />
The "\n" method puts the data on a new line and the join() method takes all items in an iterable and joins them into one string.

<br />
To edit "import_file", we must open it as a "w" writable file.
